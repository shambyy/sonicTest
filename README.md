# Eye of The Liger: Educational Music Video


## General Description


This educational video is meant to encourage students as they study! 
It incorporates a fun song, cheesy lyrics, and friends! What more could you ask for?
Featuring a parody/cover of "Eye of the Tiger," singer Paris Wilson, and others, 
it is called "Eye of the Liger," as it's not quite a tiger!


## Sonic Pi Audio


Grounded by Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger," the song closely follows the most popular 
parts of the song, but everything takes a more tech-y, sci-fi tone! 

Early on it incorporates a quick, steady background beat that loops throughout the
entire song; this is done using a distinct synth feature and sets a quick pace to balance
out the song. 

From there, I use a growing noise by building an attack and releasing briefly.
Afterwards there is the iconic beat building. This part was the trickiest of the song!
This portion helped build anticipation for the heart of the song, but required a lot
of careful manipulation. I don't have a strong understanding of music, so when my sister
told me my tempos weren't quite lining up here I found the syncing feature helpful, 
as I was able to sync this portion with the background beat. From here, I had to listen
to the section over and over and add/take mildly to the release and add/take from the rests.
This loops over twice before another build up with a different synth tone. 

Now the chorus!
Next I have a block for two of the main lines from the song, a separate piece 
for the following lines, and then a repeat of the two main lines. There's another 
section, then I reverse the build up structures I used in other parts of the song
to foreshadow the end before playing the build up portion again as my outro. 

I have to give credit to my sister and a a few of my friends! My sister helped me
practice through the song at the start, as she played everything for me on the guitar
and gave me a crash course on scales and notes and such. She helped me decide octaves
and a majority of the notes! My friends were also forced to hear the song over 
and over and recommended I lengthen or shorten certain releases or rests. 



## Music Video


Bringing together my music and lyrics:

As this is meant to be an educational music video to the tune of "Eye of the Liger,"
I knew the music video had to be motivational! At the start, we see two students
beating their fists in line with the beat that plays throughout the entire song. 

Afterwards, another student is seen entering "study mode," as he gets to work on some
studying and sips on his energy drink while considering how he can store data 
for his assignments. This then flashes to our list introduction!

A line of students then appears, with the star being the index of our list. This student
holds up an "i" for index! He is then seen physically traversing our list, and viewers 
are reminded that the list helpfully holds our data/people. Of course, the students/data
are training/fighting all the meanwhile.


# Brainstorming 

## Three pieces of music I find helpful for studying:

### 1.	Eye of the Tiger

- Encouraging! Makes me get into a studying, productive mood and think of someone 
training for a big battle/exam. It pushes the idea of someone pushing themselves and getting the job done!

- High energy! It’s silly, but it’s uplifting and fun!

### 2.	Jazz

- No lyrics, which encourages thought. It’s certainly tricky to think during a very lyrically busy 
and crowded song. Just having instruments helps leave room for conversation in my head. I know a lot 
of other students similarly prefer instrumental songs for intense study sessions for the same reasons. 

- Doesn’t require much thinking!

### 3.	Planets Song

- “Mercurio, Venus, la Tierra, Marte, Jupiter, Saturno, Urano, Neptuno, y Plutón (ya no)!”

- This is a song my mother taught me ages ago; it has all the planets in it. It’s in order of 
their orbit and even includes Pluto at the end as well as a quick disclaimer that reminds us Pluto is no longer a planet!

- This song is very catchy and is, to this day, how I remember the order of the planets. 

- The lyrics are short and sweet, as is the catchy tune!

## Incorporating these elements:

### -	Lyrics

- I wanted to copy the iconic style of the lyrics in “Eye of the Tiger,” while also 
following a more instrumental based piece. To do this, I picked out key lines from the 
original song then took my list concept and applied the most important aspects into a 
description that was short, catchy, and musically appropriate! Syllable consideration 
was quite important here, and it certainly helped having someone who wasn’t tone-deaf singing the words for me!

### -	Popular Song

- In terms of making the song uplifting, I did my very best to line up my audio with the original beats 
of the song. As someone with no music theory background, this was very tricky. Pretty early on I realized 
that choosing to attempt a cover/parody was trickier for me, because if I’d done jazz or lo-fi music I 
could’ve put in any combination of chords and notes that sounded right instead of crafting “Eye of the Liger.” 
However, hearing your excitement, Professor, in class is what kept me from switching tracks! (Thank you!) This process meant 
figuring out the notes of the song and adjusting to fit the tech-y vibe I wanted as well as realizing that full 
sheet music was not free online–quite the dead end, so I’m especially thankful for my sister being able to recognize 
notes. From here, once I knew which sections to emulate, I had to figure out the timing of each note and respective rests. 

- I’m happy with the outcome of my song, as I have all the elements I wanted going in: fun, motivational, unique, 
and catchy! I hope you enjoy!
